# 4620_libpd-drum-sequencer
 
To start off my final project, I worked on creating a generative drum sequencer. I wrote the code so that every four measures, a new beat is generated. Each drum sound has a corresponding array of probabilities that will determine whether a step should have a bang or not. This creates a random drum pattern that regenerates every few times it plays. Going forward, I plan to spend more time in Unity to make the game objects more dynamic and interesting. I also plan to add a melody to the drum patterns.
